# 🛒 Add to Cart Page (Static)
This is a static Add to Cart page layout built using HTML and CSS as part of my 100 Days of Code challenge. The page visually represents a product list with "Add to Cart" buttons and a cart summary section, focusing on layout, design, and responsiveness.

🔑 Key Features:

- Product cards with images, titles, and prices
- Visual "Add to Cart" buttons (non-functional)
- Cart section with placeholder values
- Clean and responsive layout

⏱️ Time to complete: ~2 hours  
📅 Challenge Day: 2
